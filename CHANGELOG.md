# Changelog

All notable changes to this project are documented in this file.

## Breaking Changes Policy

- API and schema contracts follow semantic versioning.
- Canonical contracts are versioned under `contracts/v{major}/`.
- Breaking API or contract changes must:
  - increment the major version;
  - preserve older contract modules for migration windows when possible;
  - be documented in the relevant release under `Breaking Changes`.

## [1.2.0] - 2026-03-19

### Added

- Streamlit runtime health section backed by:
  - `pipeline_manifest.json`
  - `artifact_validation_report.json`
  - `freshness_report.json`
- Operational documentation for:
  - runbook
  - troubleshooting matrix
  - release process
  - ADRs
  - hiring review perspective
- Warehouse consumption tests that validate downstream analytical queries against the persisted SQLite warehouse.

### Changed

- Main README and localized READMEs now include Mermaid diagrams where they reduce reviewer effort.
- Streamlit overview now surfaces operational credibility, not only business KPIs.
- Logistic regression training now uses a more stable solver for this repository context, removing recurring test-suite warnings.

### Portfolio Deltas

- The repository now communicates architecture, operation and trade-offs much faster to recruiters and tech leads.
- The dashboard better reflects a real internal decision tool by exposing runtime health.
- Warehouse validation now demonstrates not just persistence, but actual analytical consumption readiness.

### Governance Deltas

- Critical operational documentation and CI gates are now protected by repository-governance tests.
- Local cache noise is more aggressively ignored to keep the repository review-ready.

## [1.1.0] - 2026-03-05

### Added

- Versioned API endpoints: `GET /api/v1/health` and `POST /api/v1/score`.
- API key validation (`X-API-Key` / bearer) with legacy header compatibility.
- Production telemetry in health payload and logs:
  - `prediction_latency_ms`
  - `request_volume`
  - `model_version_usage`
- Versioned model registry layout:
  - `data/processed/registry/<model_name>/model_vN/`
  - `data/processed/registry/<model_name>/latest.json`

### Changed

- `/health` and `/score` remain available as backward-compatible aliases.
- Model loader now prioritizes the latest versioned registry and still supports legacy `model_registry` paths as fallback.

## [1.0.0] - 2026-03-05

### Added

- API token authentication for `/score` in demo mode by default (`X-API-Token` or bearer token).
- In-memory rate limiting for `/score` with configurable per-minute quota.
- Versioned data contract source at `contracts/v1/data_contract.py`.
- Release notes document for `v1.0.0` with business deltas.

### Breaking Changes

- Contract source of truth moved from `contracts/data_contract.py` to `contracts/v1/data_contract.py`.
  Compatibility import path is still available in `contracts/data_contract.py`.

### Business Deltas

- Prioritization output now ships with API hardening (token + quota) for safer partner demos.
- Product baseline established with versioned contract governance for future API evolution.
- Latest reference run keeps positive scenario economics:
  - Top 10 net impact: `2,550.13`
  - Top 10 simulated ROI: `1.58x`
  - 90-day uplift vs baseline: `+4,165.63`
