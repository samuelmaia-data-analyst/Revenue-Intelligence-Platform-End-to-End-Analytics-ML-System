# Merge Policy

## Purpose

This repository does not need heavy process. It does need clear merge expectations so quality does not depend on memory or enthusiasm.

## Required Labels

Recommended labels for issues and pull requests:

- `runtime`
- `data-quality`
- `warehouse`
- `dashboard`
- `api`
- `dbt`
- `docs`
- `breaking-change`

These labels are intentionally small. They should describe the primary surface affected, not every possible side effect.

## Merge Gate

Do not merge unless all relevant checks are green:

- lint and static checks
- pytest suite
- dashboard smoke
- API smoke
- downstream SQL smoke
- processed exports smoke
- partner payload smoke
- dbt SQLite smoke
- package build

## Review Expectations

Every PR should make these points obvious:

1. what changed
2. why it changed
3. what runtime surface is affected
4. what validation was run
5. what residual risks remain

## Merge Rule

Prefer squash merge for coherent, reviewable changes.

Do not merge:

- mixed-scope PRs with unrelated changes
- undocumented contract changes
- runtime behavior changes without matching tests or docs
- "cleanup" PRs that weaken the official execution path

## Release Alignment

If a PR changes runtime behavior, contracts, dashboard behavior, dbt assumptions, or reviewer-facing documentation, it should also consider:

- `CHANGELOG.md`
- `docs/releases/`
- `docs/runbook.md`
- `README.md`
