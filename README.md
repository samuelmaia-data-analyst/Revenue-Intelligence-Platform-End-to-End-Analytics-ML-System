# Revenue Intelligence Platform

Production-minded revenue analytics repository that turns customer and order behavior into governed batch outputs, warehouse-ready tables, executive decision artifacts, and a Streamlit workspace for actioning revenue opportunities.

Language versions:

- [Português do Brasil](README.pt-BR.md)
- [Português de Portugal](README.pt-PT.md)

## Executive Summary

This repository is designed to answer the questions a hiring manager, tech lead, or senior reviewer usually asks about data portfolio work:

- Is there one official runtime path?
- Can the pipeline be reprocessed safely?
- Are outputs validated and governed?
- Is there operational evidence when runs fail?
- Does the dashboard consume trusted artifacts rather than re-implementing business logic?

Short answer: yes.

## Why This Repository Exists

Most data portfolio projects stop at notebooks, ad hoc scripts, or a standalone dashboard. This repository is intentionally narrower and more operational:

- one official batch entrypoint
- deterministic and reprocessable outputs
- runtime manifests, logs, snapshots, and retention rules
- governed processed artifacts with validation and contracts
- downstream consumers that read the batch core instead of replacing it

The goal is not to simulate an enterprise platform without substance. The goal is to demonstrate sound engineering judgment in a repository small enough to inspect end-to-end.

## Business Value

The platform converts customer behavior data into assets that support commercial and retention decisions:

- churn risk and next-purchase propensity
- unit economics by acquisition channel
- cohort retention analysis
- customer-level recommendations with simulated impact
- executive KPI snapshots and monitoring outputs
- warehouse tables ready for SQL and dbt-style consumption

## Official Runtime Path

```powershell
python -m src.pipeline run
```

The batch pipeline is the system of record. The Streamlit app, API layer, warehouse, and dbt project all consume outputs produced by it.

## Architecture

```

Key characteristics:

- batch-first architecture with local reproducibility
- explicit runtime policy for retries, retention, freshness, and quality thresholds
- processed and operational report validation before pipeline completion
- SQLite warehouse by default, with compatibility paths for service and dbt consumers

## Reliability and Data Engineering Signals

- idempotent batch execution and reprocessing support
- configurable retry policy per stage
- explicit backfill window in CLI and manifests
- freshness, quality, and processed artifact validation reports
- operational reports validated as part of the processed contract surface
- runtime manifests, logs, and snapshots for traceability
- warehouse persistence plus downstream consumption validation
- partner-facing payload generated from governed processed exports
- smoke-tested Streamlit dashboard in CI

## Streamlit Workspace

The dashboard is not a second source of truth. It consumes processed artifacts generated by the batch pipeline and is organized into:

- `app/ui` for layout primitives and visual consistency
- `app/views` for business sections and user flows
- `app/dashboard_data.py` for cached artifact access
- `app/dashboard_i18n.py` for `EN`, `PT-BR`, and `PT-PT`

## Local Setup

```powershell
python -m venv .venv
.venv\Scripts\activate
python -m pip install --upgrade pip
python -m pip install -r requirements.txt -r requirements-dev.txt
Copy-Item .env.example .env
```

Optional dbt CLI setup in an isolated environment:

```powershell
python -m venv .dbt-venv
.dbt-venv\Scripts\activate
python -m pip install --upgrade pip
python -m pip install dbt-core dbt-sqlite
```

Important environment variables:

- `RIP_DATA_DIR`
- `RIP_WAREHOUSE_TARGET`
- `RIP_RETRY_ATTEMPTS`
- `RIP_QUALITY_MAX_NULL_FRACTION`
- `RIP_BACKFILL_START_DATE`
- `RIP_BACKFILL_END_DATE`

## Run Commands

Pipeline:

```powershell
python -m src.pipeline run
```

Backfill:

```powershell
python -m src.pipeline run --start-date 2025-01-01 --end-date 2025-03-31
```

Streamlit:

```powershell
streamlit run app/streamlit_app.py
```

Make-based workflow:

```powershell
make verify
make smoke-dashboard
make pipeline
```

## Validation and Automation

Core validation commands:

```powershell
python -m ruff check .
python -m black --check .
python -m isort --check-only .
python -m mypy src services contracts main.py
python -m pytest -q
python scripts/smoke_dashboard.py
python scripts/smoke_api.py
python scripts/smoke_downstream_sql.py
python scripts/smoke_processed_exports.py
python scripts/smoke_partner_payload.py
python scripts/smoke_dbt_sqlite.py
python -m build
```

Automation surfaces:

- `Makefile` for local developer workflows
- `.pre-commit-config.yaml` for fast local quality gates
- `.github/workflows/ci.yml` for lint, tests, smoke, and build validation
- `.github/workflows/ci.yml` also runs a dbt-on-SQLite downstream smoke against the generated warehouse
- downstream smoke scripts share a common temporary-runtime helper in `scripts/smoke_support.py`

## SQL Consumption Examples

See [docs/sql_examples.md](docs/sql_examples.md) for practical warehouse queries covering channel economics, recommendation ranking, cohort retention, and executive segment views.

## Technical Decisions and Trade-offs

- SQLite is the default warehouse because local reproducibility matters more than introducing mandatory external infrastructure.
- The project is batch-first on purpose. It demonstrates disciplined analytics engineering instead of pretending to be a full streaming platform.
- The Streamlit app consumes artifacts instead of recomputing core business logic, preserving one authoritative runtime path.
- Compatibility shims exist, but canonical imports remain explicit and documented.

## What This Repository Is Not

- not a notebook collection
- not a fake enterprise monorepo
- not a streaming platform demo
- not an MLOps platform clone

It is a production-minded batch analytics system sized honestly for a strong senior-level portfolio.

## Roadmap

Current high-impact next steps:

1. expand processed artifact contracts and integration coverage
2. deepen downstream warehouse and dbt validation beyond SQLite local-first assumptions
3. accumulate more small, coherent release notes
4. add a lightweight visual regression strategy for the dashboard
